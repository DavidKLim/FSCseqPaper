## Simulations

Procedure for simulating data can be followed
[here](https://github.com/limddavid/FSCseqPaper/tree/master/SimulateData).
Then, all simulation analyses done in the FSCseq paper can be replicated
by following the steps
[here](https://github.com/limddavid/FSCseqPaper/tree/master/Simulations).
All analyses were run as batch jobs in slurm.
